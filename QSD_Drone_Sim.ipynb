        "The **Standard Quantum Limit (SQL)**, also known as the shot-noise limit, sets a fundamental bound on the precision of measurements when using independent particles (like individual qubits in separate measurements). For estimating a parameter using $N$ independent measurements, the uncertainty in the estimation scales as $1/\\sqrt{N}$.\n",

        "The **Heisenberg Limit** is a more stringent, ultimate limit on measurement precision allowed by quantum mechanics. It states that the uncertainty can be reduced to scale as $1/N$ for $N$ quantum resources (like qubits). This represents a quadratic improvement in precision compared to the SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-qubit entanglement** is key to surpassing the SQL and approaching the Heisenberg Limit. By preparing the $N$ qubits in an **entangled state**, such as a Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state ($|00...0\\rangle + |11...1\\rangle$), the qubits are no longer independent. This collective, correlated state allows for more sensitive detection of the parameter being measured. The entangled state evolves more rapidly with respect to the parameter than a product state of independent qubits.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "* The Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) limits measurement precision to $1/\\sqrt{N}$ for $N$ independent resources, while the Heisenberg Limit allows for a precision scaling of $1/N$ using $N$ entangled resources.\n",
        "* Multi-qubit entanglement, specifically using a GHZ-like state, enhances sensor sensitivity by causing measurement outcome probabilities to change more significantly for a given phase shift compared to a single-qubit sensor.\n",
        "* For a phase shift of $\\pi/4$, the theoretical probability of measuring '0' for a single-qubit sensor changes from 1 (at phase 0) to approximately 0.8536, while for a 3-qubit sensor, the theoretical probability of measuring '000' changes from 1 to approximately 0.1464.\n",
        "* The larger change in probability for the multi-qubit sensor (0.8536 vs 0.1464) demonstrates its significantly higher sensitivity to the phase shift.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "* The enhanced sensitivity of the multi-qubit entangled sensor indicates a move towards the Heisenberg Limit, offering the potential for quadratically improved precision in parameter estimation compared to the SQL.\n",
        "* Future steps could involve implementing parameter estimation techniques (e.g., Maximum Likelihood Estimation) on the simulation results to quantify the uncertainty and directly compare the scaling ($1/\\sqrt{N}$ vs $1/N$) for single-qubit and multi-qubit sensors."
